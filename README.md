## About

This repository is a hands-on crash course for building AI agents that can:

- Download and parse content (e.g. markdown files, documentation) from GitHub repositories  
- Extract metadata using frontmatter  
- Index content (in later stages)  
- Create a conversational interface or chatbot over repository content  

It’s built to follow a day-by-day or module-by-module learning path, inspired by “7-day AI agent crash course” style content. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Motivation

As more knowledge is stored as documentation in repositories (readmes, md files, tech specs), it becomes useful to interact with that content conversationally. Rather than browsing documentation manually, an AI agent could allow:

- Asking questions in natural language  
- Retrieving relevant content  
- Explaining, summarizing, or acting on that content  

This repo gives you a foundation for building that.
